Are you tired of all that messaging stuff from people who you just don't care of?

Here comes the solution.

  * That old man you met at a party keeps writing about his passion for blonde, young women? *Fibonaccialo*.

  * A friend of yours won't stop tormenting you with the photos of his beautiful tatooes? *Fibonaccialo*

  * That guy at the pub insists on buying you beers and vodka shots? *You idiot. Take them.*

## Usage ##
*Fibonaccialo* defends you from spammer lovers by piping in both directions a facebook conversation with a Cleverbot session.

Just clone the repo, run *make* and then enter your informations into *./leonardo.sh*. The script/repo name is due to Leonardo Fibonacci,
which first of all proposed a good algorithm to put people into friend-zone by answering each Facebook message after *nextFibonacciNumber()* minutes.

You will need to input your facebook address (which for most of all is ID@chat.facebook.com), your password for logging in and the numerical ID of the person you want to *Fibonacciare*.

*leonardo.sh* will do everything for you.

## Software requirements ##
Being ~~a piece of crappy copypasta~~ such a highly-engineered software, *Fibonaccialo* needs *libpurple* (Pidgin) and *sendxmpp* to be installed and configured to work properly.

## Final notes ##
Well, enjoy it.
